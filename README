StreamTran model for simulating 1d transport in streams subject to atmospheric equilibration, groundwater inflow, first-order reaction.

It is especially suited for transport of environmental tracers such as radon, noble gases, dissolved CFC's, SF6, etc.

Dependencies:

    requies the tracer_tools package to be in the python path - lots and lots of tracer utilities in this package
    requires the fipy package
    requires the lmfit package
    -> things work better if fipy and lmfit can be installed using your system package manager.

An example and template input deck (moderately well commented) can be found in the examp directory.
