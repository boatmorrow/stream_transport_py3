StreamTran model for simulating 1d transport in streams subject to atmospheric equilibration, groundwater inflow, first-order reaction.

It is especially suited for transport of environmental tracers such as radon, noble gases, dissolved CFC's, SF6, etc.

Dependencies:

Python package requirements:
numpy,scipy,matplotlib
pandas
lmfit
iapws
xlrd
tkinter
tracer_tools package to be in the python path - lots and lots of tracer utilities in this package
https://github.com/boatmorrow/tracer_tools_py3

    -> things work better if all packages besides tracer_tools can be installed using your system package manager.

An example and template input deck (moderately well commented) can be found in the examp directory.

INSTALLATION
To install StreamTran:

Navigate to a directory where you would like StreamTran to reside.

Clone the git repository.  For example, using git at the terminal

git clone https://github.com/boatmorrow/stream_transport_py3


This will add a directory with the StreamTran repository.  Now, add the downloaded repository directory to your PYTHONPATH and PATH variables.  For example, using a bash terminal:

export PYTHONPATH=path/to/repository:$PYTHONPATH 
export PATH=path/to/repository:$PATH
